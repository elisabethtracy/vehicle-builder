# Vehicle Builder
 
## Description
 This project consists of a terminal [npm] application that allows users to either create a new vehicle or pick an existing vehicle from a list, and perform various auto-related actions with it. The user can return to the action menu after each action until they decide to exit the application. The purpose of this project was to gain more experience and practice with using Typescript and OOP, and to create a functioning application to build and use imaginary vehicles.

## Installation
 To install this application, the user must run the 'npm install' function to first download the 'inquirer' package, and ensure that all other files are imported properly. The user would then run 'npm run start' in the integrated terminal in order to launch and run the application.
 
## Usage
 The user will then be prompted to either create a new vehicle, to which they can enter all pertinent vehicle details, or they can select a vehicle from an existing     list. Once a vehicle is selected or created, the user can use the arrow keys to select an option from various actions that can be performed either to or with the    vehicle, such as turning, accelerating, or starting the vehicle. In order to perform more specialized options, such as being able to tow another vehicle or perform a wheelie, the user must have the correct type of vehicle selected to perform said action(s), otherwise they will receive an error message and be prompted to select  another vehicle. The user can exit the application at any time by selecting the 'exit' option.
